### Project Description
Sustainable Fashion Marketplace for Women is a platform that enables women to buy and discover pre-loved, upcycled, and eco-friendly clothing. The solution offers AI-powered recommendations, , and a community forum to make sustainable fashion more accessible, and impactful. It aims to reduce textile waste while empowering women to make conscious fashion choices.


### The Problem statement
The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters globally, contributing to massive textile waste and high carbon emissions. Women, who are the primary consumers of fashion, often face barriers to sustainable shopping due to high costs and limited availability of eco-friendly options. Current platforms lack a centralized marketplace for  sustainable fashion that fosters a community of conscious consumers.

### The Solution
Our Sustainable Fashion Marketplace for Women addresses these challenges by offering a one-stop platform where women can easily buy,  and discover sustainable fashion. The platform features AI-based recommendations for eco-friendly alternatives,  and a community forum to connect and inspire women on their journey toward more sustainable fashion choices.
